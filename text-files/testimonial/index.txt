                            I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                            people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                            shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                            I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                            necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the
                            rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.

                        learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                        about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                        for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                        tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                        certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
